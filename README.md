# About Me

My name is Evelyn Fettes and I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Linguistics at Cornell University.  I focus on morphology and syntax, particularly the structure of noun phrases in Austronesian languages.  I am also a terrible coder, so this website is still in the process of being built.  GitHub Desktop seems easy?
